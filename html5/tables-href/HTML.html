   <p>Article:
   </br>
   After a devastating defeat against the amazing brazilian team 'FURIA Esports', G2 Esports was not able to proceed to the BIG stage. Maybe next time if AleksiB does a better job at shotcalling. Poor performance by their star player's Jackz and AleksiB left their fans wondering what will become of G2 Esports.
   </br>
   Will they come back stronger next year or not? Will they ever be able to get back on track and win a major? Probably not. But who knows what else they have in store for us.
